## Detailed Description

THE PROBLEM

Every AI chat gives you a text box as the only way to respond. When the AI gives a long response and you agree with half and disagree with half, your only option is to type a paragraph explaining that. Most people don't bother. The conversation drifts.

THE SOLUTION

Recurate adds annotation tools to AI conversations. A side panel mirrors the AI's latest response, and you can highlight what matters and strikethrough what doesn't.

- Highlight (green) = "This is valuable. Keep going here."
- Strikethrough (red) = "This is wrong. Drop it."

Annotations are automatically injected into the chat's text box as structured KEEP/DROP feedback. When you send your next message, the AI knows exactly what you valued and what you didn't.

HOW IT WORKS

1. Click the Recurate icon to open the side panel
2. Chat with the AI as usual
3. When the AI responds, the side panel shows the response
4. Select text and use the floating toolbar to highlight or strikethrough
5. Your annotations appear in the text box automatically
6. Type your next question below the feedback and send

WHY THIS MATTERS

Annotations compound. Turn 2 annotations make turn 3 better. By turn 5, the conversation is precisely tuned to what you care about — in a way that text-only conversations never achieve.

You become the curator of the conversation's memory, not a passenger.
