# Don't just chat, recurate.

**Recurate** gives you annotation tools for AI conversations — highlight what matters, strikethrough what doesn't, and watch the conversation get sharper every turn.

## The Problem

Every AI chat interface — Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini — gives you exactly one way to respond: **a text box**.

When the AI produces a detailed response and you agree with half, think one paragraph is brilliant, and another is completely wrong — your only option is to type a lengthy message explaining all of that. Most people don't bother. The conversation drifts.

**The text box is the only way to talk to AI. That's a problem.**

## The Solution

**Highlight** and **strikethrough** parts of an AI response instead.

- **Highlight** = "This matters. Carry this forward."
- **Strikethrough** = "This is wrong or irrelevant. Drop it."

These gestures communicate in seconds what would take paragraphs to type. The AI gets clear signal about what you valued and what you didn't, and the next response is better for it.

## Two Products

### Recurate Annotator — Chrome Extension

A lightweight Chrome extension that adds annotation tools to any AI chat interface. Works on claude.ai, chat.com, grok.com, and gemini.google.com. No backend, no API keys — just install and your conversations immediately get better.

**Status:** In development

### Recurate Roundtable — Multi-LLM Platform

Send your question to multiple AI models simultaneously. A synthesized shared context captures the best of each response. Annotate across all models — curate a conversation richer than any single model could produce alone.

**Status:** Design phase
